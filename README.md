# redis-cluster
Simple redis cluster for learning purpose provisioned using vagrant. Also created this for some exercise before migrating current redis cluster we have from ubuntu 16.03 to 20.04 because 16.04 will not receive security patch anymore. Don't forget to migrate yours.

Some good resource around redis cluster:

- https://redis.io/commands/cluster-info
- https://redis.io/topics/replication

Don't hesitate to use `CLUSTER HELP` :smile:
